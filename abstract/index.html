      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>This paper aims at exploring techniques and ideas used in simulating motion phenomena found in nature, by breaking down such phenomena into various components as motivated by [Schiffman 24] in his book <em>Nature of Code</em>. The focus is majorly on the components - motion, randomness and autonomy. The paper also attempts to introduce coding paradigms and methods by using a simplified and easy-to-use programming language - <em>p5.js</em> as we move along in our explorations.</p>
