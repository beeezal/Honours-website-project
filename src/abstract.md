This paper aims at exploring techniques and ideas used in simulating motion phenomena found in nature, by breaking down such phenomena into various components as motivated by \[Schiffman 24\] in his book *Nature of Code*. The focus is majorly on the components \- motion, randomness and autonomy. The paper also attempts to introduce coding paradigms and methods by using a simplified and easy-to-use programming language \- *p5.js* as we move along in our explorations.
